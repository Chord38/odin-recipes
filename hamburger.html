        <h1>The 'best' hamburger</h1>
        <img src="./images/72657-Best-Hamburger-Ever-Heather888_5563136_original-1x1-1-708040cad1634829af20f5116acf4425.jpg">
        <p>Ah the hamburger, a dish which needs little introduction. The recipe below is from
            Allrecipes, and it describes it as the 'best' hamburger. There is certainly more 
            to it than a basic hamburger but as for the best, well that is a matter for you to decide.
        </p>
        <p>One more thing to note is that the recipe as provided by Allrecipes, in addition to calling for salt,
            contained many salty ingredients. I have taken the liberty of removing salt from the ingredients list.
            I have also switch from soy sauce to Tamari sauce to remove gluten from the recipe. However, if you can tolerate
            gluten you may prefer soy sauce instead. I believe there will be enough salt in the recipe
            even with these changes and probably too much (for taste nevermind health) without them.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef</li>

            <li>½ cup shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon crushed dried rosemary</li>
            <li>pepper to taste></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, 
                garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt,
                 and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
            <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear,
                 about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
                  at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
