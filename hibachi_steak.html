    <h1>Hibachi Steak</h1>
    <img src="./images/hibatchi steak.jpeg" alt="hibatchi steak">
    <p> Hibachi steak is is an enjoyable bit of Japanese cuisene. The dish consists of steak grilled on a 
        flat metal pan and marrinated with soy sauce. It is typically served with fried rice and
        carrots and/or mushrooms. The term 'hibachi' is something of a misnomer. The cooking 
        style described is called Teppanyaki. The term hibachi refers to a type of cookware,
        but has often been conflated in the west to refer to the cooking style.

    <p> What follows is a brief recipe and ingredient list for a gluten free hibachi style
         steak preperation. It has been tweeked a bit for cooking in a westen kitchen and I
         myself have cooked on a few occasions. To cook this dish in a gluten free manner
         is fairly straight forward and consists primarily of swtiching standard soy sauce
         out for Tamari sauce. The recipe, to be sourced properly at a later date, is derived
         from The Spruce Eats https://www.thespruceeats.com/grilled-hibachi-steak-recipe-336291.
